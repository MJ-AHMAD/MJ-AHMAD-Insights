# Markdown Website

## What is this?

This is an example website using markdown with GitHub pages to be used as a learning tool. You can look up how everything was made in the GitHub repo linked above. I recommend hitting the **Raw** button when looking at a `.md` file in GitHub to see the source text rather than the rendered text.

The website's URL is [https://csc109.github.io/MarkdownWebsite/](https://csc109.github.io/MarkdownWebsite/).
