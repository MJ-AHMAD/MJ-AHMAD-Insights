# Emojis

A full list of supported emojis can be found [here](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#emoji-cheat-sheet).

Make sure to have the `jemoji` plugin applied in your `_config.yml` file!

Below are my most used emojis (they look a bit weird on GitHub but eh I always refer to this as emoji accents, like platforms have slightly different verisons of the same emojis you know?):
