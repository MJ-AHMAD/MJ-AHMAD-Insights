# Spacing

## Extra New Lines

A quirk of markdown is that no matter how many new lines you place in between text, it will only render it as one new line. To insert more new lines, the `<br />` HTML tag must be used.

Hi, this text
<br />
<br />
<br />
has multiple lines between it

## Extra Spaces

Another quirk of markdown is that no matter how many spaces you place in between two words, it will only render one space. To insert more spaces, the `&nbsp;` text must be used.

Hi, this text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has multiple spaces between it
